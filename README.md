# CyberPatriot Automated Security Hardening Tool

This repository contains an automated PowerShell script for CyberPatriot competitions that performs common security hardening tasks on Windows systems.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server
- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Administrator privileges

### Running the Automation Suite

**EASIEST METHOD - Use the Master Control Script:**

1. **Download or clone this repository**

2. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**
   - Right-click on PowerShell and select "Run as Administrator"

3. **Navigate to the repository directory**
   ```powershell
   cd path\to\Windows-Stuff
   ```

4. **Run the master control script**
   ```powershell
   .\Run-CyberPatriot.ps1
   ```

5. **Follow the interactive menu**
   - **First:** Analyze README (extracts competition requirements)
   - Choose Quick Audit for a fast security overview
   - Run Security Hardening to apply automated fixes
   - Run Server Hardening if on Windows Server
   - Run File Auditor to find unauthorized files
   - Run User Auditor to review accounts
   - **Last:** Run Windows Update (option W)
   - Or select "R" to run all tasks in sequence!

**ALTERNATIVE - Run individual scripts:**
   ```powershell
   .\AnalyzeReadme.ps1         # Parse competition README (do this first!)
   .\CyberPatriot-Auto.ps1     # Main security hardening with GUI
   .\ServerHardening.ps1       # Windows Server-specific hardening
   .\FileAuditor.ps1           # Find unauthorized files/software
   .\UserAuditor.ps1           # Review user accounts
   ```

## 🆕 NEW: README Parser

The suite now automatically reads the competition README to avoid false positives!

**Supports:**
- Text files (.txt, .md)
- **Desktop shortcuts (.lnk)** that point to websites
- Internet shortcuts (.url)
- **Manual paste** if auto-download fails

**Extracts:**
- Authorized users and administrators
- Allowed software/programs
- Required services (won't disable these!)
- Server roles (DNS, DHCP, IIS, AD DS)
- Forensics question indicators
- Password policy requirements

**How to use:**
1. Place README file/shortcut on Desktop (or it will auto-find it)
2. Run `.\AnalyzeReadme.ps1` first
3. If download fails, paste content manually when prompted
4. Other scripts automatically use the parsed data

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY INFORMATION

### 🆕 README-Aware Filtering
**The scripts now read the competition README to avoid false positives!**

**What this means:**
- Users listed in README won't be flagged as unauthorized
- Software listed in README won't be flagged for removal
- Services listed in README won't be disabled
- Server roles from README guide which hardening to apply

**How it works:**
1. Run `AnalyzeReadme.ps1` first
2. It parses the README (even if it's a .lnk shortcut!)
3. Creates ReadmeData.json with requirements
4. Other scripts automatically load and use this data

**If README is a .lnk shortcut (common in CyberPatriot):**
- Script automatically extracts the URL
- Downloads the web page content
- Parses it for requirements
- If download fails, you can paste content manually!

### 🛡️ Forensics Questions Protection
**IMPORTANT:** Some files on the competition system are needed for forensics questions!
- The scripts automatically exclude files/folders with "CyberPatriot", "Forensic", or "README" in the name
- **FileAuditor.ps1 ONLY REPORTS findings - it does NOT delete anything**
- **ALWAYS manually review files before deleting**
- Files needed for forensics points include:
  - Images with hidden data
  - Files with specific hashes
  - Encrypted or encoded files
  - README files with competition instructions

### What These Scripts Do NOT Do
- **Does NOT change your current user's password** - You must manage passwords manually
- **Does NOT delete ANY files** - Scripts only report findings; you delete manually
- **Does NOT delete unauthorized software automatically** - It will detect but requires manual removal
- **Does NOT interfere with CyberPatriot competition files** - These are automatically excluded
- **Does NOT modify registry beyond documented security settings**
- **Does NOT answer forensic questions** - These require manual analysis

### Before Running ANY Script
1. ✅ **Read the competition README file thoroughly**
2. ✅ **Write down your password on another computer** - Critical!
3. ✅ **Complete all forensics questions FIRST** - Don't risk losing points
4. ✅ **Review what each script does** - Understand the changes being made

### Manual Tasks Still Required

Based on the checklist, you should still manually:

1. ~~**Read the competition README file thoroughly**~~ (Do this FIRST, before scripts!)
2. ~~**Write down your password on another computer**~~ (Do this FIRST!)
3. ~~**Answer forensic questions**~~ (Do this BEFORE running FileAuditor!)
4. **Review user accounts** - Verify which users should exist per README
5. **Review installed software** - Decide what should be removed per README
6. **Check for media files** - Use FileAuditor, then MANUALLY delete after review
7. **Review browser settings** - Configure Firefox/Chrome security
8. **Update browsers** - Firefox, Chrome, Edge
9. **Review shared folders** - Check for unauthorized shares
10. **Run final system updates** - After all other changes

## 🎯 Best Practice Workflow

1. **Before the Competition**
   - Familiarize yourself with the script
   - Read through the checklist folder materials
   - Practice on a test system

2. **During the Competition**
   - Read the README file first (always!)
   - Write down your password
   - Answer forensic questions
   - **Run the automation script:** `.\CyberPatriot-Auto.ps1`
   - **Run the file auditor:** `.\FileAuditor.ps1` (to find files to delete)
   - **Run the user auditor:** `.\UserAuditor.ps1` (to review accounts)
   - Delete unauthorized files and software based on audit results
   - Perform remaining manual tasks from the checklist
   - Review and verify all changes
   - Run system updates last

3. **After Running the Script**
   - Review the log file for any failures
   - Fix any issues that couldn't be automated
   - Verify security settings are applied
   - Test system functionality
